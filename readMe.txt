🤖 What is Self-RAG (Self-Reflective RAG)?
Self-RAG is an advanced version of Retrieval-Augmented Generation where the LLM evaluates its own answer and decides whether to improve it by re-retrieving or rephrasing.

It adds a reflection step to traditional RAG. This helps the model:

Detect uncertainty or lack of coverage.

Request more information.

Regenerate a better answer.

🧠 Self-RAG = RAG + Self-Evaluation
Steps:

Retrieve documents based on a query.

Generate an initial answer.

Reflect: “Is this answer complete and accurate?”

If not satisfied, re-query or rephrase.

Return the improved answer.
